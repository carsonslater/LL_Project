# Whenever you make changes to the model final, you need to apply it to the whole database


python manage.py createsuperuser

adding a webpage:
urls map to views, and views map to index files (HTML template)

FOR VIEWS:
in topics for keys, they represents variable name used in the template, and
values are the variable name used in the view "topic_id" vs "topic.id"

When creating a new instance of a form, commit = FALSE does not save the form to the database.



Setting up user accounts:
    - Need to make sure that the user cannot access information from other accounts.


- python manage.py startapp users

Every app comes with urls


Allowing users to own their data
